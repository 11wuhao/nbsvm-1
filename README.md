This script reproduces performance of the NB-SVM on the IMDB reviews from the
paper:

Sida Wang and Christopher D. Manning: Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification; ACL 2012.
http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf

They obtain XX while this code obtains XX with bigrams and XX with trigrams.
Little improvement versus the paper.
